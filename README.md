This repository contains the code for my 2021/2022 personal portfolio site.

The site was described ([by one Twitter user](https://twitter.com/fubits/status/1469395932026486789?s=20)) as the "new benchmark for individual portfolio websites."

See the [site](https://www.connorrothschild.com/), my [announcement Tweet](https://twitter.com/CL_Rothschild/status/1469064267294986241), or the [accompanying blog post](https://www.connorrothschild.com/post/this-site).
