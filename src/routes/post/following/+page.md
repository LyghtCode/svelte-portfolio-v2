I've been asked a few times for recommendations as to "who to follow" in the data viz/design space. To prevent accidentally omitting people (and stay up to date), this page will serve as a running, non-exhaustive list of the people I recommend others follow.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to awesome data design folks that learn in public. If you know of any you think should be added, [let me know](https://twitter.com/CL_Rothschild).
