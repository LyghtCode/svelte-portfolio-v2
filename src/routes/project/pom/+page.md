[**Peace of Mind**]I want to thank everyone who was involved with making this project. I love you all.

Last year I went from being just a producer to rapping and singing on my tracks. It was fun at first and it got me some attention, but it also set an expectation for myself to hit every time I dropped a song. Then that expectation soon turned into pressure and I found myself blindlessly making music that I thought would be hits for other people. I stopped making music for myself and I soon would dread making it because it would expose my insecurities that I had as a person. Streams and attention are one thing, but when I saw myself tying my worth to the amount that was given to me, I realized that it wasn't healthy. I wanted to quit. I had problems with myself that manifested into my career and it was time to take action for myself physically and mentally. During that time (which was this summer) I still kept music close, but as I dealt with my issues i found that my relationship with music had changed. Instead of making generic, algorithmic songs that I thought would hit, I found that I could make music that helped me get through the days of feeling alone and help me heal: loving myself and the process of making music again.

For me, these are songs that give me a feeling I haven't felt in a long time about myself, my life, or my music. Music has became my friend that i could tell anything and not be judged. I feel pure. Music no longer gave me anxiety, but instead a peace of mind. I had so much fun creating these songs, and at first, I was going to keep these to myself, but scrolling through social media and talking to friends, I realize that im not the only person who can relate to these feelings and I hope that when you listen you can take something from my journey.
