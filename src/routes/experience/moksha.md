I currently work as an Associate and Data Scientist at [Moksha Data](https://www.mokshadata.com/). I'm currently building **Moksha Interactive**, a subsidiary of Moksha Data which specializes in telling visual stories on the web. 

At Moksha, Iâ€™ve been able to build dashboards, reports, and web applications for our partners in the social impact space (like Harris County, the Houston Food Bank, and others).

Here are a few of my favorite projects so far:

* [Harris County Rental Assistance Dashboard](https://mokshadata.gitlab.io/harris-county-svi/)
* [An Interactive History of Impact Investing](https://mokshadata.gitlab.io/collaborative-fund/impact-investing-interactive/)
