I currently work as an Associate and Data Scientist at [Moksha Data](https://www.mokshadata.com/). I'm currently building **Moksha Interactive**, a subsidiary of Moksha Data which specializes in telling visual stories on the web. 

At Moksha, I've been able to build dashboards, reports, and web applications for our partners in the social impact space (like Harris County, the Houston Food Bank, and others).

Here are a few of my favorite projects so far:

* [Harris County Rental Assistance Dashboard](https://mokshadata.gitlab.io/harris-county-svi/)
* [An Interactive History of Impact Investing](https://mokshadata.gitlab.io/collaborative-fund/impact-investing-interactive/)
