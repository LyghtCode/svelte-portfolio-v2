I spent the summer of 2020 as a data science intern with the [US Special Operations Command](https://www.socom.mil/). I was matched with USSOCOM through [Coding it Forward](https://www.codingitforward.com/), a prestigious fellowship that matches technical students with government agencies in need of assistance.

During the tenure of my internship, I built a full stack web application that automated the process of verifying inventory data. This tool is estimated to save roughly 2,500 man hours and $102,000 annually.
