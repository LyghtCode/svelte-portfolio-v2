My first formative data science experience was with the Texas Policy Lab. I joined TPL as a research intern and slowly made my way into data science as I taught myself R.

At the Lab, I eventually assumed the position of Senior Data Science Intern. I worked directly with our lead data scientist on dashboards, static reports, and standalone analyses for our government partners. 

We used a variety of tools, such as PowerBI and R Shiny, to build dashboards for partners like the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, the Texas Department of Family Protective Services, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
